# README

Welcome to the back-end of Watering Can!

To get started you will need:

* Ruby 2.6.1
* Rails 5.2.4
* Bundler 2.0.0
* Postgresql

Once you have those, clone the app to your computer!

Navigate to the directory in terminal
Use
```
   bundle install
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
   rails server
```
to set up the database and start the server. If there are any errors with the above commands try:
```
   bundle install
   bundle exec rails db:create
   bundle exec rails db:migrate
   rails server
```


Now that the back end is up and running, let's head over to the front end at:
