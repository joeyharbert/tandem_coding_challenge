Welcome to the back-end of Watering Can!

To get started you will need:

* Ruby 2.6.1
* Rails 5.2.4

Once you have those, clone the app to your computer!

Navigate to the directory in terminal
Use
```
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
   rails server
```
to set up the database and start the server.

Now that the back end is up and running, let's head over to the front end at:

to move on!
